# Dino Game using Reinforcement Learning

## Playing Chrome's Dinosaur Game with DQN

### Introduction

This project implements and trains an agent to play the Dinosaur Game using Deep Q Network (DQN). The network architecture for DQN to train the agent is similar to what proposed in the original paper.

The project also implements a custom gymnasium (previously OpenAI gym) environment for training a reinforcement learning agent to play the Dinosaur Game. For more details, see the envs.py file.

Note: this environment is a simplified replication of the Dinosaur Game, hence missing some features/game mechanisms.

Note: this project specifies Python version 3.11.*

The reward is defined to be alive

The model's best parameters are in the train folder
